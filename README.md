![Diabetes Prediction]

This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of a person having diabetes based on certain medical features. The model is trained on a dataset containing historical medical records of individuals, and it can help healthcare professionals and patients identify potential diabetes cases early on.

## About the Project

Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection and intervention are crucial for managing the condition effectively. This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of an individual having diabetes based on factors such as glucose levels, BMI, age, and more.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from [Dataset Source]. It contains a collection of features such as:
- Glucose levels
- BMI (Body Mass Index)
- Age
- Blood Pressure
- Insulin levels
- Diabetes pedigree function
- Skin thickness
- Outcome (0 for non-diabetic, 1 for diabetic)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using: git clone https://github.com/code-with-praveen143/Diabetes_Prediction_System
2. Navigate to the project directory: Diabetes_Prediction system
3. Install the required dependencies using: pip install requirements.txt
4. Make predictions: Use the trained model to make predictions on new data.
   
## Model

We use a diabetes_prediction_model model for this prediction task. The model is trained using the dataset mentioned above and achieves an accuracy of 90% on the test set.

## Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. 

## Contributing
